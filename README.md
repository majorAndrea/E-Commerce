# E-Commerce
My first front-end project with React.

Summary:

In this e-commerce WebApp users have two ways of doing the login, via Google or normal form registration. Then users can choose some product and also review them with a five stars system, add them to the cart and then review the order on a checkout page, and then completing the order via the PayPal payment method. Once the payment is successfully completed, the user will be redirected to a checkout confirmation page with the order summary and some other information. And the order details are stored on firestore db.

Tech used:

- React
- React Router DOM
- Context API
- Redux
- Redux Saga
- Redux Persist
- Firebase
- React PayPal
- Reselect
- Boostrap
- Styled Components

SIDE-NOTE: There are some mixed technologies in this project because I have created this project while learning React, Redux, Firebase, etc... and I like to experiment
while learning new things and I learn really well and fast when I do practice.

-> From time to time I update this project. Live Version Soon.
